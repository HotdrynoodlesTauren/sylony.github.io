# Project Objective
This is my personal website homepage, also a project for my CS5610 Web Dev class. In this project, we are supposed to build a personal website by HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and JS. There should be at least two pages introducing our skills, projects, hobbies, etc, and templates are allowed. The final product should be of W3C compliance, as well as formatted by eslint and prettier.
